## I. Why graph?

If you look closely at your smart phoneâ€™s applications or many other technical applications, the graph actually appears in every corner of our lives. From finding the shortest path from a location to another on Google Maps to graphing your connections on social media.

Finding an optimal graph algorithm will reduce a great amount of cost or compute resources when applying graph with real lifeâ€™s great amount of data like millions of real worldâ€™s streets (example of finding the shortest path on Google Map). (Well, unless you are trying to calculate the shortest distance between you and your crushâ€™s heart, canâ€™t help you with that ðŸ˜…)

## II. What is a graph (in data structure and algorithm)?

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*_ZLmV0IH7_j8eQUrlG76hg.png)

 1. A graph is a set of vertices and a collection of edges that each connect a pair of vertices. (Sedgewick, Algorithms 518)

2. There are two types of graph

3. Loop and Multiple edges

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*m2YDWOeLmjWrKl3xI7R5Ug.png)

A **loop** is an edge that connects a vertex to itself. If a graph has more than one edge joining some pair of vertices then these edges are called **multiple edges**.

4. Simple Graph

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*eZ6bBNttU8etFZ2m0Vgo1Q.jpeg)

A **simple graph** is a graph that does not have more than one edge between any two vertices and no edge starts and ends at the same vertex. In other words a simple graph is a graph without loops and multiple edges.

5. Degree of a Vertex

6.Path

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*w01pdHWNDujdZoIRFh-Pfg.jpeg)

A **path** is a sequence of vertices with the property that each vertex in the sequence is adjacent to the vertex next to it. A path that does not repeat vertices is called a **simple path**.

7. A Connected Graph

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*8aIjeWLKSAPqxg3khYTVlQ.jpeg)

A graph is said to be **connected** if **any two** of its vertices are joined by a path. A graph that is not connected is a **disconnected graph**. A disconnected graph is made up of connected subgraphs that are called **components**

8. Weight:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*6R5gBfMBbqZb3J1SU0c28w.gif)

In a weighted graph, each vertex is assigned with a numerical value

9. Adjacent matrix and Edge list representation:

## III. Types of graph algorithm:

### **1. Graph traversal:**

Essential â€” BFS (breadth-first search) and DFS (depth-first-search)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*GT9oSo0agIeIj6nTg3jFEA.gif)

DFS: begin from starting vertex to ending vertex, and repeat until all vertexes are covered.

BFS: begin from starting vertex to all vertexes but level by level.

**a. Breadth-first search:**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*KAZbkOGxRrmTokzX6af2vA.gif)

Description: BFS is used to find the shortest path from a vertex to another (these vertexes should be connected) or path from 1 vertex to other vertexes in a graph.

A great BFS demo by Sadanand Pai: [https://sadanandpai.github.io/shortestpathfinder/](https://sadanandpai.github.io/shortestpathfinder/)

Detailed explanation: [https://www.educative.io/edpresso/how-to-implement-a-breadth-first-search-in-python](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/how-to-implement-a-breadth-first-search-in-python)

Type of graph: undirected, directed, do not have weights (if not, weights are equal)

Algorithmic use cases: finding the shortest path between two nodes, testing if a graph is bipartite, finding all connected components in a graph, etc.

Complexity: O(V+E) â€” where V is the number of vertexes and E is the number of edges.

**Code:**

i. Implementing BFS:

ii. Print path (2 methods):

iii. Example usage:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2720/1*gTiwg6QRb6ENcjOvmUOKmg.png)

**b. Depth-first search:**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*qKBL47VFOJs4loXu1rVUDA.png)

Description: DFS is used to find a path from a vertex to another (these vertexes should be connected). DFS solution is not necessarily the shortest path.

Detailed explanation: [https://www.educative.io/edpresso/how-to-implement-depth-first-search-in-python](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/how-to-implement-depth-first-search-in-python)

Type of graph: undirected, directed

Algorithmic use cases: topological sorting, solving problems that require graph backtracking, detecting cycles in a graph, finding paths between two nodes, finding an exit of a maze, etc.

Complexity: O(V+E)

**Code:**

i. Implementation:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2720/1*g5jpogk2frllkaLWX1a04g.png)

ii. Example usage:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2720/1*G2mt-kGla_esyV7CslQEBg.png)

### **2. Finding the path with the lowest cost or shortest path (besides BFS):**

*In this chapter, for each edge, there will be a weight (cost) between two vertexes.*

a. Bellman-Ford

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*SdJ4ZUD4XuiJEqORTJn2GQ.gif)

Description: [Single-source] To find the path with the **lowest cost from one vertex to every other vertex. Can be used to detect negative-weight cycle**

Detailed explanation: [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bellman-ford-algorithm-simple-implementation/](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bellman-ford-algorithm-simple-implementation/)

Type of graph: undirected, directed, have weights, **weights can be positive or negative**

Complexity in this implementation: O(V.E)

**Code:**

i. Implementation:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2720/1*tbvKRVJhFY3TEAt9cFWvpA.png)

ii. Example usage:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2720/1*-ngNUkyehk0CndENE2pMjA.png)

b. Dijkstra

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*15KkonMRnHdbzGhFw0PXCA.gif)

Description: [Single-source] Dijkstra is used to **finding a path with the lowest cost from one vertex to every other vertex.**

Detailed explanation: [https://www.bogotobogo.com/python/python_Dijkstras_Shortest_Path_Algorithm.php](https://www.bogotobogo.com/python/python_Dijkstras_Shortest_Path_Algorithm.php)

Type of graph: undirected, directed, have **positive weights**

Complexity: O(VÂ²) â€” optimal: O(ElogV) with a heap (priority queue)

**Code:**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2720/1*dv3iuAL-dDWDgnFlBdQS7w.png)

c. Floyd-Warshall

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*CAa3Bt9rB_l5p8wjm_5puA.png)

Description: [All-pairs] Floyd-Warshall is used to finding the shortest path for all pairs of vertexes.

Detailed explanation: [https://www.programiz.com/dsa/floyd-warshall-algorithm](https://www.programiz.com/dsa/floyd-warshall-algorithm)

Brief explanation:
>  *Floyd-Warshall uses Dynamic Programming method to save initial results into an array. Then it will run a loop again to check middle vertexes and their cost between themselves and starting and ending vertex.*
>  *If current cost > (new cost 1 (start tonew vertex) + new cost 2 (new vertex to end))*
>  *then the current cost will update itself with (new cost 1 + new cost 2)*

Type of graph: **directed only, weights can be negative or positive, cannot be used in the negative cycle**

Complexity: O(VÂ³)

Code:

i. Implementation

ii. Sample usage:
