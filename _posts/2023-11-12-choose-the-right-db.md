> This is a continuation of my [previous post](https://christopherle.com/blog/2023/backend-languages/) on top backend languages and when to use them. Following [this back-end basic roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/backend), I will be going over the basics of backend languages in today post. I won't be covering everything, just my takeaways of what I think is valuable.

Before we start, let's me say there is no one-size-fits-all database. Each database has its own pros and cons. It's important to understand the trade-offs of each database before choosing one. We won't be covering much about scaling database in this post. Just the initial setup and how to choose the right database for your task.
