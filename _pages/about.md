I was born in a small city called Tuy Hoa, Vietnam where I found interests in engineering from my dad's garage. 

I took 2 gap years to study Full-stack development and Machine Learning at [CoderSchool](https://www.coderschool.vn/en). During this time, I learned iOS development and found a project named [Mind Your Neck](https://thanhnien.vn/sinh-vien-sang-tao-ung-dung-ngua-benh-cho-gioi-van-phong-185792676.htm). The project stopped as I thought I still need to learn a lot to scale in production. 

I started college at [Augustana College](https://www.augustana.edu/) where I earned Donald E. McLaughlin Award for Excellence and Achievement in Computer Science (top 1% of class). During this 4 years, I had a chance to intern at both startups [IMI.AI](https://imi.ai/), [CloudQuant](https://www.cloudquant.com/), and big tech such as [Google](https://www.google.com/about/careers/applications/?src=Online%2FHouse%20Ads%2FSKWS) - Cloud team. I also had experience in Machine Learning while working [Dr. Tauheed](https://sites.google.com/site/tauheedresearch). At the end of these 4 year, I am confident to create and scale a full-stack web app from sratch with data analytics. My current knowledge contains Full-stack Development, AI, Networking/Infrastructure, and System Engineering. 

While working in industry, I found many software optimization still relies on hardware configuration in which I have not studied at college. I am studying hardware while working with [CYOBot](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cyobot/cyocrawler-building-tomorrows-innovators) to bring robotics and programming learning to everyone. My experience is very diversified but I am a quick learner and goal-oriented. I'm on my quest to find what my specialization is. 

My goal is that one day to connect all of these dots needed for a strong system together. I hope to share my knowledge with others by my experience with DevRel. 

I read a lot about philosophy, religion, and economics. I also taking photos at [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@chrislevn07)

I’m best reached via [email](christopherle0711@gmail.com). I’m always open to interesting conversations and collaboration.
