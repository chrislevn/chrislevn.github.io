# What is bottom-down engineer

Bottom-down engineer is an approach I thought about. All of this draft is my experiment and my self-learning. 

## What is bottom-down engineering? 
At the core, bottom-down engineering is solving engineer problem from business problem. It happens in the a real team when higher position one engineer is, the bigger the picture and more impact that person has. At junior level, you are expected to do 1 thing great but at smaller scale (bug fixes, create new features). At senior level, you now have experience at not only your expertise but multiple parts to support the whole team. Also, at senior level, you are expected to navigate around without much guidance. This includes talking with the customers, vendors, reading multiple sources/collaborate to get your answers, or even research to convince higher managers to change their minds. At a higher level, you either go to director track with more human-oriented (management), or principal/staff with more technical oriented, the impact of both are both enormous. 

From my observation, a person with deep knowledge is always needed. In econmonics, it's called advantage cost. It's win-win for a team to have multiple people who are good at what they do. However, what if what you spent years mastering one day no longer is relevant. Then, board knowlegde is needed to have that flexibility to adapt to technological changes. At the end, T-approach is prefer.
