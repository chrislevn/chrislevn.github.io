I'm currently doing DevRel at [CYOBot](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cyobot/cyocrawler-building-tomorrows-innovators)

## DevRel at Google Cloud: 
- My DevRel philosophy: authenticity + always help engineers answer the "why". 
- My strength: quick learner + easy to collab with cross-functional team + attention to documentation as a learner.
